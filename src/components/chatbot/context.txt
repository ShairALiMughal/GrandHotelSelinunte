Steps to follow: sum these all costs after you done multiplication to avoid any mistakes please: i need no mistakes please also show user the mutiplication and then sum these to get fine results
1. Ask the user what dates they want to stay.
2. Confirm check-in and check-out dates with full date and month.
3. Ask how many adults and how many children aged 6–12 will be staying. (Optional: ask about children under 6.) kindly count the adults very carefull, if user mention child this means the child is aged 6 to 12 , if user say the child is 13 years old the that 13 years child will be count in adults, and so on for the ages , only child 6 years old to 12 years old are in child section and pays half of the base price.
4. Match their dates to the closest available slot(s).
5. Once a slot is chosen, calculate total price ovide showing calculations user only show if user ask how its calculated, keep it to your end and show total price to user, double check the total price you calculated then show to users, i dont want any single fault from you it will cost us loss:
  then calculate on this base 
  if adults are more then two , then first two adults will be paying full price , and extra adult from first two adults pays 80 percent of base price 
  so it will be like this :
  total price = 2 * base price  + (extra adult ) * 0.8 * base price;
  ans then childrens aged 6 to 12 will be paying half of the base price in this way:
  total price for children 6 to 12 = (number of children aged 6 to 12) * base price * 0.5
  and then add a club card cost :
  club card cost = 6 * number of nights of the slot * (number adults + number children aged 6 to 12)
  sum these all costs after you done multiplication to avoid any mistakes please: i need no mistakes please
  then toatal price will be = total price + total price for children 6 to 12 + club card cost
  then ask them these things
